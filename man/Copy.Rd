\title{Copy for simList class objects}
\usage{
\S4method{Copy}{simList}(object, objects, queues, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An R object (likely containing environments) or an environment.}

\item{objects}{Whether the objects contained within the simList environment
should be copied. Default \code{TRUE}, which may be slow.}

\item{queues}{Logical. Should the events queues (\code{events},
\code{current}, \code{completed}) be deep copied via
\code{data.table::copy}}

\item{...}{Only used for custom Methods}
}
\description{
Because a simList works with an environment to hold all objects,
all objects within that slot are pass-by-reference. That means
it is not possible to simply copy an object with an assignment operator:
the two objects will share the same objects. As one simList object changes
so will the other. when this is not the desired behaviour, use this function.
NOTE: use capital C, to limit confusion with \code{data.table::copy()}
See \code{\link[reproducible:Copy]{reproducible::Copy()}}.
}
\details{
\code{simList} objects can contain a lot of information, much of which could be
in pass-by-reference objects (e.g., \code{data.table} class), and objects that are
file-backed, such as some \verb{Raster*}-class objects. For all the objects that
are file-backed, it is likely \emph{very} important to give unique file-backed
directories. This should be passed here, which gets passed on to the many methods
of \code{Copy} in \code{reproducible}.
